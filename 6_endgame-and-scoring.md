## Endgame conditions

The game ends when:
- the Anglo-Dutch Treaty is revealed, and there are **fewer than 3 Ships** in the Port; or
- at the **end** of a round, there are no Event cards left.

> *Example.* There are 3 Ships in the Port. The Temenggong goes on a Raid and removes a Ship. But then the Sultan reveals the Perahu battle card, adding one Ship back. After Upkeep and Cleanup, the Anglo-Dutch Treaty is drawn. Phew --- the game is not over yet!

## Scoring
Players now tally Victory Points:
- already earned on the Victory Track;
- from Legacies; and
- from End Game bonuses, if any.

The player with the most Victory Points wins, securing their legacy as the "founder among founders" of Singapore.
