## Endgame and Scoring

The game ends when there are no Event cards left.

Players now tally Victory Points:
- already earned on the Victory Track;
- from Legacies; and
- from End Game bonuses, if any.

The player with the most Victory Points wins, securing their legacy as the "founder among founders" of Singapore.
