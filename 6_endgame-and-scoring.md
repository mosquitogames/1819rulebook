## Endgame conditions

The game ends when, at the **end** of a round,

- there are no Event cards left; or
<!-- - all ships are on the Port track, i.e., Singapore prospers; or -->
- no Ships are left, i.e., Singapore collapses.

<!-- > *Example.*  On his first action, the Sultan goes on a successful Raid, removing the last Ship from the Port track. But on his second action, the Sultan clears a District, adding one ship back. The game is not over yet! -->

## Scoring
Players now tally Victory Points:
- already earned on the Victory Track;
- from Legacies;
- from End Game bonuses, if any;
- from their Storehouse, split evenly between faction players (rounding down).

The player with the most Victory Points wins, securing their legacy as the "founder among founders" of Singapore.
