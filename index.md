# 1819 Singapore

A game for 4 players in 90 minutes.

## Introduction
The year is 1819. **British Agents** have arrived on the shores of Singapore, bringing indigenous **Malay Rajas** face to face with the might and industry of a rising colonial power.

Only one ruler's legacy will endure the centuries---but legacy means nothing if Singapore collapses. So the rulers must work together...for now.

## Goal

The player with the most **Victory Points** (VPs) at the end of the game wins. Players earn Victory Points by:

- Influencing **Districts**;
- Winning **Wars**;
- Collecting **Taxes**; and
- Fulfilling **Legacies**.

## Characters
There are two British Agents, the **Lieutenant-Governor** and the **Resident**; and two Malay Rajas, the **Temenggong** and the **Sultan**. Victory is not shared by factions---only one player can win the game.

## A Historical Notanda
*1819* is a game of politics. The political toolbox available to players is determined by the Treaty currently in effect.

When the British Agents initially arrived in the Malayan Straits --- a corner of which is now known as *Singapura*, Singapore --- they were initially allied with the local Malay Rajas against their common rivals, the Dutch and the Bugis. This alliance was cemented by the Singapore Treaty of 1819. Thus, at the start of the game, **War** is rather costly.

However, halfway through the game, the Anglo-Dutch Treaty makes peace between the Dutch and the British Agents, who no longer need to appease the Malay Rajas. The Singapore Treaty is overruled, the Rajas lose their leverage, and the threat of War looms larger on the horizon...

The goal of the game --- to have the most VPs --- represents attaining the persistent historical status enjoyed by the real-life Lieutenant-Governor of Singapore, Stamford Raffles, who has roads, schools, and at least one hotel named after him.

*1819* gives the other historical players a chance at the spotlight.

## Two Modes
One central goal of *1819* is to highlight the situations and choices of the Malay Rajas when the British first arrived: their mindsets and attitudes toward these foreigners; the opportunities available for mutual enrichment, but also for resistance.

Most games in the Euro and Euro-adjacent genre allow players to take on the role of colonizers; some other games wonderfully forefront the strategies and experiences of the colonized. We wanted to go one step further, and allow players to take on both sides in the same game, despite the genuine (military) asymmetry between the two factions.

Thus, *1819* has two modes of play: **Fantasy Mode** and **Simulation Mode**.

In **Fantasy Mode**, Rajas have some kind of "spiritual attunement" that allow them to summon higher-Strength Battle cards from mythology and folklore, thus matching British Agents' military firepower.

In **Simulation Mode**, Rajas instead must choose whether to become Colonial Allies, giving up their goals of sovereignty in exchange for some material compensation; or to become Resistance Leaders, throwing away all opportunity for mutual enrichment and instead taking a high-risk, high-reward path of rebellion.

We recommend you first play **Fantasy Mode**.
