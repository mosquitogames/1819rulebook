# 1819 Singapore

A game for 4 players in 90 minutes.

## Introduction
The year is 1819. **British Agents** have arrived on the shores of Singapore, pitting indigenous **Malay Chiefs** against the might of the largest empire the world has ever seen.

Only one ruler's legacy will endure the centuries---but legacy means nothing if Singapore collapses. So the rulers must work together...for now.

## Goal

The player with the most **Victory Points** (VPs) at the end of the game wins. Players earn Victory Points by:

- Influencing **Districts**;
- Winning **Wars**;
- Collecting **Taxes**; and
- Fulfilling **Personal Objectives**.

## Characters
There are two British Agents, the **Lieutenant-Governor** and the **Resident**; and two Malay Chiefs, the **Temenggong** and the **Sultan**. Victory is not shared by factions---only one player can win the game.

## A Historical Notanda
*1819* is a game of politics. The political toolbox available to players is determined by the Treaty currently in effect.

When the British Agents initially arrived in the Malayan Straits --- a corner of which is now known as *Singapura*, Singapore --- they were initially allied with the local Malay Chiefs against their common rivals, the Dutch and the Bugis. This alliance was cemented by the Singapore Treaty of 1819. Thus, at the start of the game, **War** is rather costly.

However, halfway through the game, the Treaty of London makes peace between the Dutch and the British Agents, who no longer need to appease the Malay Chiefs. The Singapore Treaty is overruled, the Malay Chiefs lose their leverage, and the threat of War looms larger on the horizon...

The goal of the game --- to have the most VPs --- represents attaining the persistent historical status enjoyed by the real-life Lieutenant-Governor of Singapore, Stamford Raffles, who has roads, schools, and at least one hotel named after him.

*1819* gives the other historical players a chance at the spotlight.
