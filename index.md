## Goal
The player with the most **Victory Points** at the end of the game wins. Players earn Victory Points by:

- Winning over **Villages**;
- Contributing the most to **Upkeep**;
- Populating Singapore with **Immigrant** communities;
- Completing **Events** successfully;
- Winning **Conflicts**; and
- Fulfilling **Personal Objectives** (WIP).

## Characters
There are two British Agents, the **Governor** and the **Resident**; and two Malay Chiefs, the **Temenggong** and the **Sultan**. Victory is not shared by factions---only one player can win the game.
