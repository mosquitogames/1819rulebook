# 1819 Singapore

A game for 4 players in 90 minutes.

## Introduction
The year is 1819. **British Agents** of the East India Company have arrived on the shores of Singapore to seek out the **Malay Rajas** and establish a new port.

Each one seeks their own advantage and dreams in the rise of the new settlement---but from collusion and competition, there will emerge only one whose name will shine brightest in the annals of history...

## Goal

The player with the most **Victory Points** (VPs) at the end of the game wins. Players earn Victory Points by:

- Influencing **Districts**;
- Winning **Wars**;
- Funding Public Works through **Taxes**; and
- Fulfilling **Legacies**.

## Characters
There are two British Agents, the **Lieutenant-Governor** and the **Resident**; and two Malay Rajas, the **Temenggong** and the **Sultan**. Victory is not shared by factions---only one player can win the game.

## Two Modes
*1819* is set in an era of colonial expansion, where the military and technological edge European powers had helped them to bring indigenous leaders to heel.

While many games allow players to take on the roles of imperialist powers, and others wonderfully forefront the strategies and experiences of the colonized, *1819* hopes to provide the rarer chance to play both the colonizer and colonized in the same game despite the power asymmetry.

Thus, *1819* has two modes of play: **Fantasy Mode** and **Simulation Mode**.

In Fantasy Mode, the Rajas' “spiritual attunement” gives them access to creatures and figures from mythology and folklore, allowing them to match the British Agents' warships and artillery with giant turtles and the mighty Spirit of Badang.

Simulation Mode returns those entities to the realm of stories, and leaves the Rajas with the choice of accepting British dominion and potential riches as Colonial Allies, or taking the dangerous path of defying them as Resistance Leaders.

We recommend you first play **Fantasy Mode**.
