## Placing Influence

Influence is added to the board in congkak fashion---one Influence per Village, in a clockwise direction, starting from any Village. When you pass by a Storehouse, you **may** choose to add an Influence to it.

When a Village has five or more Influence tokens on it at the end of an Influence addition, the Village is cleared of tokens in two possible ways:

1. **For points.** British players only get Victory Points from British (blue) Villages being cleared, and similarly Malay players only get Victory Points from Malay (green) Villages being cleared. Players of that faction get one Victory Point for each Influence token of theirs on the Village, multiplied by the Village multiplier. Opponent tokens are returned to opponents.
2. **For storehouse.** Players may opt to forfeit points, and instead transfer all the contents of a Village into their faction Storehouse.

When a Village is cleared, a new ship enters the Port. 

## Populating Districts
Players must **Populate** these Villages to uncover them before Influence tokens can be placed. But as more Villages are unlocked, the cost of Upkeep also increases.

Three on the British side, and three on the Malay side. 
The black marker covering a Village may only be removed once all the Population spaces underneath it have been filled. When a **sixth** Population cube is placed on a Population space, the space is filled.

Every time a Village is unlocked, the black marker moves to cover the next leftmost circle on the Multiplier track.

Winning over these unlockable Villages yields x2 and x3 Victory Points, respectively. But as more Villages are unlocked, costs of Upkeep also rise!

Though all players have a stake in the development of Singapore, each player also has their own ideologies and private agendas. Private Objectives may cause players within the same faction to be at odds: one British Agent may want to abolish Opium Farms, but the other wants to keep them as a source of tax revenue.

Players may reveal Private Objectives and claim associated Victory Points as soon as the condition is met. Some Private Objectives can be fulfilled at the end of a turn or round. Others can only be fulfilled at endgame.

## Flipping Cards
When Public Works are unfunded or Vices are outlawed, their physical structures --- while still standing --- have been shuttered, and the workers tending to its functions have left.

Thus, face-down cards remain in their places on tableaus, but cannot be Activated. All associated Tax or Public Work tokens are removed. All attached Population cards and corresponding cubes are discarded. If the card was part of a Community, the Community is divided.

Face-down cards may be "rebuilt" (i.e., turned face-up) as a free Action by paying their cost. Rebuilding restores Tax or Public Work tokens to the appropriate tracks. Rebuilding does **not** restore discarded Population, nor does it rebuild a broken Community.

> *Example.* Your Tableau had one Community, consisting of G.D. Coleman, School, and Resident.
- Dring Upkeep, you were unable to fund your School.
- So you flip the card over and discard the Population card and player tokens.
- You also remove one Public Work token from the track.
- G.D. Coleman and Resident are now standalone cards.

## Moving Cards

## Resources
Emporium, Population, and Battle decks are finite. Player tokens, population cubes, and money are not. Should the game run out of the latter, use suitable replacements.
