## Placing Influence

Influence is added to the board in congkak fashion---one Influence per Village, in a clockwise direction, starting from any Village. When you pass by a Stronghold, you **may** choose to add an Influence to it.

When a Village has five or more Influence tokens on it at the end of an Influence addition, the Village is cleared of tokens in two possible ways:

1. **For points.** British players only get Victory Points from British (blue) Villages being cleared, and similarly Malay players only get Victory Points from Malay (green) Villages being cleared. Players of that faction get one Victory Point for each Influence token of theirs on the Village, multiplied by the Village multiplier. Opponent tokens are returned to opponents.
2. **For stronghold.** Players may opt to forfeit points, and instead transfer all the contents of a Village into their faction Stronghold.

When a Village is cleared, a new ship enters the Port. 

## Populating Villages
Players must **Populate** these Villages to uncover them before Influence tokens can be placed. But as more Villages are unlocked, the cost of Upkeep also increases.

Three on the British side, and three on the Malay side. 
The black marker covering a Village may only be removed once all the Population spaces underneath it have been filled. When a **sixth** Population cube is placed on a Population space, the space is filled.

Every time a Village is unlocked, the black marker moves to cover the next leftmost circle on the Multiplier track.

Winning over these unlockable Villages yields x2 and x3 Victory Points, respectively. But as more Villages are unlocked, costs of Upkeep also rise!

Though all players have a stake in the development of Singapore, each player also has their own ideologies and private agendas. Private Objectives may cause players within the same faction to be at odds: one British Agent may want to abolish Opium Farms, but the other wants to keep them as a source of tax revenue.

Players may reveal Private Objectives and claim associated Victory Points as soon as the condition is met. Some Private Objectives can be fulfilled at the end of a turn or round. Others can only be fulfilled at endgame.


## Resources
Player tokens, population cubes, and money are not finite. Should the game run out, use suitable replacements.
