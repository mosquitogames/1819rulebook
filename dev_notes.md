## A Historical Notanda
*1819* is a game of politics. The political toolbox available to players is determined by the Treaty currently in effect.

When the British Agents initially arrived in the Malayan Straits --- a corner of which is now known as *Singapura*, Singapore --- they were initially allied with the local Malay Rajas against their common rivals, the Dutch and the Bugis. This alliance was cemented by the Singapore Treaty of 1819. Thus, at the start of the game, **War** is rather costly.

However, halfway through the game, the Anglo-Dutch Treaty makes peace between the Dutch and the British Agents, who no longer need to appease the Malay Rajas. The Singapore Treaty is overruled, the Rajas lose their leverage, and the threat of War looms larger on the horizon...

The goal of the game --- to have the most VPs --- represents attaining the persistent historical status enjoyed by the real-life Lieutenant-Governor of Singapore, Stamford Raffles, who has roads, schools, and at least one hotel named after him.

*1819* gives the other historical players a chance at the spotlight.

## Major additions planned

### "Build-a-leader"
{: .no_toc }
In the game you played, the player boards come prebuilt with characters based on historical figures, and some adaptation of their real-life Legacies and Attributes. We plan to flesh out some system for players to pick and choose Legacies and Attributes to "build a leader" with a unique combination of philosophy, desired legacy, and special ability. 

We imagine double-sided player boards like the ones in *Ghost Stories*. The front would be the player boards you played with, based on our "main cast" of historical figures. For the reverse, we're considering a couple of options:
- another prebuilt character, with perhaps more complex (but still pre-balanced) Legacies and Attributes; or
- an entirely blank slate with spaces to place Legacy and Attribute tiles.

### Player counts
{: .no_toc }
The game was primarily built for and tested on a 4-player setup. With some tweaks, we've seen the game work at 3 and even 2 players, though the tweaks haven't been tested extensively and have room for improvement.

<!-- ## Currently thinking about
- British twist in Simulation Mode.
- Sustaining and boosting player interest in the final third -- keeping the game state flexible enough to change in the final third.
- Sharpening Leader and card "personalities", and game balancing next. -->
