## Major additions planned

### "Build-a-leader"
In the game you played, the player boards come prebuilt with characters based on historical figures, and some adaptation of their real-life Legacies and Attributes. We plan to flesh out some system for players to pick and choose Legacies and Attributes to "build a leader" with a unique combination of philosophy, desired legacy, and special ability. 

We imagine double-sided player boards like the ones in *Ghost Stories*. The front would be the player boards you played with, based on our "main cast" of historical figures. For the reverse, we're considering a couple of options:
- another prebuilt character, with perhaps more complex (but still pre-balanced) Legacies and Attributes; or
- an entirely blank slate with spaces to place Legacy and Attribute tiles.

### Player counts
The game was primarily built for and tested on a 4-player setup. With some tweaks, we've seen the game work at 3 and even 2 players, though the tweaks haven't been tested extensively and have room for improvement.

### Simulation mode

One central idea for *1819* in exploring the history of Singapore was to highlight and explore the situation and choices the colonized Malay leaders at the time: their mindset, attitude toward the British, the opportunities for mutual enrichment but also the modes of resistance available.

Most games in the Euro and Euro-adjacent genre (mostly thinking about *Catan*) allow players to take on the role of colonizers; some games (e.g., *Pamir*) wonderfully forefront the strategies and experiences of the colonized, but given the genuine (military) asymmetry between the two factions, we haven't seen any games that allow players to take on both sides, in the same game.

The solution we put forward in the [museum version of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLmy896EBU4) was to have two play modes. We think this is still a good way forward. The first mode (which is the version you played) we call Fantasy mode, similar in conceit to *Spirit Island*, where Malay leaders had some kind of "spiritual attunement" that allowed them to summon higher-Strength Battle cards from mythology and folklore.

But we hope to go beyond the *Spirit Island* approach, whose fantastical/supernatural elements make for a great game, but which are geared more for a sort of wish fulfillment rather than an attempt at historical retelling --- and it is the latter we hope to do.

Thus the second mode, Simulation mode, in which we hope to explore what "winning" means for an outgunned, colonized people --- which we argue involves a seismic shift of mindset and self-perception on behalf of the Malay Chiefs that allowed them some sense of achievement despite political, if not material, subjugation. 

(This is the path that the descendants of Temenggong Abdul Rahman would take, going the way of Anglophilia and integration into British society.)

The main idea is that Malay Chiefs would no longer have access to their higher-strength mythical Battle cards, but would now have the ability to swap out their starting Legacies based on sovereignty and self-sufficiency (accumulate Wealth, become 'Pirate King') in favor of "Colonial Legacies" (e.g., recruiting British personalities) that 1) penalize British Agents who wage war anyway on colonial subjects, and 2) give Malay Chiefs a new avenue to earn VPs, at the "cost" of the Legacies they had dreamt for themselves.

We wanted to firm up Fantasy Mode before complicating our systems with Simulation Mode. Many things are still up in the air --- none of the mechanics above have been tested at length, and indeed there may be better game designs that achieve a similar historical argument. Nonetheless, the intention to develop this mode stands.

## Currently thinking about
- Reducing chores (flushing Market, moving First Player token, double-tracking population as cards and as cubes) and potential fragility (preventing Pirate King from ending the game in the first round).
- Handling Vice cards and Slavery cards ethically and tastefully, respecting the sensibilities of an international audience while staying true to the Southeast Asian historical context.
