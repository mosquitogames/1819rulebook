## Major additions planned

### "Build-a-leader"
In the game you played, the player boards come prebuilt with characters based on historical figures, and some adaptation of their real-life Legacies and Attributes. We plan to flesh out some system for players to pick and choose Legacies and Attributes to "build a leader" with a unique combination of philosophy, desired legacy, and special ability. 

We imagine double-sided player boards like the ones in *Ghost Stories*. The front would be the player boards you played with, based on our "main cast" of historical figures. For the reverse, we're considering a couple of options:
- another prebuilt character, with perhaps more complex (but still pre-balanced) Legacies and Attributes; or
- an entirely blank slate with spaces to place Legacy and Attribute tiles.

### Player counts
The game was primarily built for and tested on a 4-player setup. With some tweaks, we've seen the game work at 3 and even 2 players, though the tweaks haven't been tested extensively and have room for improvement.

## Currently thinking about
- British twist in Simulation Mode.
- Sustaining and boosting player interest in the final third -- keeping the game state flexible enough to change in the final third.
- Sharpening Leader and card "personalities", and game balancing next.

## Rulebook to-dos
- List Leader Actions
- Update images
- Add Mythic icon explanation
- Add Folk Hero examples
- Bold all game words
- Talk about Battle card passives
