## Anatomy of an Event card

![Event cards](img/events_anatomy.jpg)

- **A. Card back.** Event I's happen before the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. Event II's happen after.
- **B. Instant effects.** These are immediately resolved from top to bottom upon revealing the Event.
> *Example.* Upon reveal of Major Economic Boom, each player takes an open card from the Market, as described by the text highlighted white. Then two ships are added to the Port.

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Instant and Conflict](img/icons/instant_conflict.png) | Resolve the **Event** / <span style="color:red"><strong>Conflict</strong></span>. See [Conflict Events Table](conflict-events-table). |
| ![Ship](img/icons/add_ship.png) | Add or remove **Ships** from Port track. |

- **C. Round modifiers.** These are highlighted in **black**, and remain in effect until the next Event card is revealed.
