## Populate

Draw the top card of the Population deck, then:
1. Resolve any instant effects;
2. Place the card in a vacant Population slot in your tableau.

**If your tableau has no vacant Population slots, you may not Populate!**

> *Example.* Your tableau has 2 cards: the Temenggong and the Opium Tax Farm.
- The Teochews Population card occupies the Temenggong's only Population slot.
- Opium Tax Farm has one free slot, allowing you to Populate it with the Javanese.
