## Populate

Draw the top card of the Population deck, then:
1. Resolve any instant effects;
2. Place the card in a vacant Population slot in your Tableau.

**If your Tableau has no vacant Population slots, you may not Populate!**

> *Example.* Your Tableau has 2 cards: the Sultan and the Newspaper.
- The Teochews Population card occupies the Sultan's only Population slot.
- Newspaper has one free slot, allowing you to Populate it with the Javanese.
