## Endgame conditions
There are three ways the game can end:
1. when there are no more Event cards to draw (i.e., after 8 rounds);
2. when the final (rightmost) Port space is filled with ships (Singapore prospers);
3. when the last (leftmost) Port space is emptied of ships (Singapore collapses).

When an endgame condition is reached, gameplay continues until Upkeep of that round is resolved. If the condition still holds, the game ends.

## Scoring
Players now tally Victory Points:
- already earned on the Victory Track;
- from endgame Private Objectives;
- from sets of Immigrant cards:

| Set of... | Victory Points |
| :---: | :---: |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 4 | 6 |

- from their Stronghold: the number of tokens minus the number of Vice tokens, split equally among faction players (rounding down). **A player may choose to forfeit their share of the Stronghold to give the other player on their faction a Victory Point boost.**

The player with the most Victory Points wins.
