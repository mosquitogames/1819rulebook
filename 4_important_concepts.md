## Placing Influence

Starting at any open District, place 1 Influence token per District, going in the direction of the arrows. When you pass by a Storehouse, you may (but need not) place 1 Influence on it.

![Starting districts](/img/districts_1.jpg)

> *Example.* On the board above,
- 2 green Districts and 1 blue District are open.
- All other Districts are closed at the moment.
- The British Storehouse has 4 Influence, while the Malay Storehouse has 3.

> You are the <span style="color:magenta"><strong>Purple</strong></span> Malay Chief. You purchase History Tome.

![Adding Influence](/img/districts_2.jpg)
> History Tome instantly gives you 4 Influence:
- You decide to place the 1st token on the first green District.
- Following the arrows, you place the 2nd token on the second green District.
- You opt to place the 3rd token in your own Storehouse.
- Finally, you must place the 4th token in the open blue District.

### Scoring Districts
{: .no_toc }

When a District contains at least 5 Influence tokens at the end of an Influence placement, the District is immediately scored as follows:

1. Check the District's color. British Agents only score VPs from blue Districts, while Malay Chiefs only score VPs from green Districts.
2. If you are eligible, count how many of **your** tokens are on the District. Gain **(District Multiplier)** VPs per token.
3. Clear the District of tokens. Return tokens to players.
4. Add a ship to the Port track.

![Scoring Districts](/img/districts_3.jpg)

> *Example, continued.* After placing Influence from History Tome, the second green District now has 5 tokens.
- The Malay Chief players --- here, the <span style="color:blue"><strong>Blue</strong></span> and <span style="color:magenta"><strong>Purple</strong></span> players --- are eligible to score.
- The District multiplier is \\(\times 2\\), so the <span style="color:blue"><strong>Blue</strong></span> player gains 2 VPs, and the <span style="color:magenta"><strong>Purple</strong></span> player receives 6 VPs.
- The Yellow player is British and receives nothing.

### Clarifications
{: .no_toc }

- When placing Influence multiple times on the same Action --- e.g., when Activating a Community where multiple cards yield Influence --- you must score and clear Districts **immediately** after each placement.

## Placing Population

Populate your faction's Districts by placing Population cubes in the **leftmost** available space below. Filling these spaces unlock higher-scoring Districts. When a District is unlocked, move the black marker to cover the next circle on the Multiplier track.

![Starting Population](/img/population_1.jpg)

> *Example.* The Malay faction has 7 Population cubes, while the British have 5.
- The Malay faction has unlocked their second green district.
- The active Multiplier is \\(\times 1\\).

![Add Population](/img/population_2.jpg)

> You are the <span style="color:red"><strong>Red</strong></span> player (British). You take the Populate Action and draw the Orang Laut, giving you 2 Population cubes.
- You place the 1st cube in the leftmost British Population space, filling it and unlocking your second District.
- You move the marker to the Multiplier track. The active Multiplier is now \\(\times 2\\).
- You place the 2nd cube on the next space.

### Losing Population
{: .no_toc }

When Population is lost, remove cubes starting from the **right**. When a space is no longer filled, the District above it closes: move the black marker back from the Multiplier track, and discard any Influence tokens on the District.

![Losing Population](/img/population_3.jpg)

> *Example, continued.* It is now the Event phase. The Minor Economic Recession appears, causing each faction to lose (2 \\(\times\\) die roll) Population cubes.
- You roll a 1. Both factions lose 2 Population cubes and close their second Districts.
- The <span style="color:blue"><strong>Blue</strong></span> player's token is discarded.

## Flipping Cards
When Public Works are unfunded or Vices are outlawed, their physical structures --- while still standing --- have been shuttered, and the workers tending to its functions have left.

Thus, face-down cards remain in their places on tableaus, but cannot be Activated. All associated Tax or Public Work tokens are removed. All attached Population cards and corresponding cubes are discarded. If the card was part of a Community, the Community is divided.

Face-down cards may be "rebuilt" (i.e., turned face-up) as a free Action by paying their cost. Rebuilding restores Tax or Public Work tokens to the appropriate tracks. Rebuilding does **not** restore discarded Population, nor does it rebuild a broken Community.

![Flipping cards](/img/flipping_cards.jpg)

> *Example.* Your Tableau had one Community, consisting of G.D. Coleman, School, and Resident.
- Dring Upkeep, you were unable to fund your School.
- So you flip the card over and discard the Population card and player tokens.
- You also remove one Public Work token from the track.
- G.D. Coleman and Resident are now standalone cards.

## Moving Cards

You can move **standalone cards** and **cards at the edges of Communities**. Population cards only move with the card they are attached to. With 1 move, you can:
- Connect a standalone card to a Community.
- Separate a card from a Community.
- Separate a card from one Community and connect it to another.

One move must be completed before the next one can begin.

![Move card](/img/move_1.jpg)

> *Example.* You have a Community of three cards and one standalone card in your tableau. You may move any card except School. With 1 move, you can:
- Connect Sports Day (together with Orang Laut) to G.D. Coleman; or
- Separate the Resident from School; or
- Separate the Resident from School and connect him to Sports Day.

## Resources
Emporium, Population, and Battle decks are finite. Player tokens, population cubes, and money are not. Should the game run out of the latter, use suitable replacements.
