![Annotated Board](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/annotated_board.jpg?raw=true)

## Player Setup

### A. Board and mini-figure

Hand each player a board. Have players on the same faction sit beside each other. For your first game, use the illustrated side of the board and place the corresponding mini-figures on their starting Leader spaces:

| Mini-figure | Starting Leader space |
| :---: | :---: |
| Governor | Market |
| Resident | Market |
| Temenggong | Battle |
| Sultan | Population |

Leader spaces reflect rulers' priorities for the round.

<!-- There must always be two Malay Chiefs. 
Which players sit beside?
-->

### B. Legacy tiles

For your first game, use the Legacies printed on the player boards. Put the Legacy tiles away.

Otherwise, shuffle each faction's Legacy tiles. Have each player draw three tiles from their faction deck, keep two, and discard the other. Put the rest of the Legacy tiles away.

### C. Wealth

Hand each player $5. Set the remaining coins near the board---this is the Bank.

<!-- > *3-player game: the solo player gets $8 to start.* -->

### D. Player tokens

Hand each player a set of colored tokens. Have each player place one token in their faction's Storehouse, and another on the zero space of the Victory Point track.

On the board, player tokens represent Influence. Filling Villages with Influence earns you VPs. Spending Influence from your faction Storehouse lets you issue Decrees or declare War. Off the board, player tokens are also used as trackers for VPs, personal objectives, or anything else.

## Board Setup

### E. Villages

Cover the x2 and x3 Villages with the four black markers. These Villages are empty; they must be Populated before players can place Influence tokens on them.

<!-- > *3-player game: the solo player only covers their x3 Village.* -->

### F. Port track

Place two Ships on the leftmost space of the Port track, and the rest near the board. Every time a Village is filled with Influence, another Ship arrives in Singapore, occupying another space on the Port track.

## Card Setup

### G. Event cards

Separate the Event cards by their backs: Event I, Event II, and the Treaties.

- Shuffle the Event II cards, then deal three face down onto the Event deck space.
- Place the Treaty of London face down on top of the Event II cards.
- Then shuffle the Event I cards and deal three face down on top of the Treaty.
- Finally, place the Singapore Treaty face down on the pile.

Put the rest of the Event cards away.

### H. Resource cards

Shuffle the Resource deck and place it face down on the appropriate space. Deal the first five cards face up onto the Market.

### I. Immigrant cards

Shuffle the Immigrant deck and place it face down on the appropriate space. Immigrant cards yield Population cubes, which unlock higher-scoring Villages. 

<!-- 
join Communities?
represent the various social groups who migrated---voluntarily or otherwise---into Singapore.
 -->

### J. Battle cards

Shuffle each faction's Battle deck and place them face down on the appropriate spaces. Have each player draw one card from their faction deck.

<!-- 
Battle cards represet the various fighting forces at each faction's disposal. British and Malay players enlist fighters from different Battle decks.

> *3-player game: the solo player draws 3 Battle cards and keeps 2.*
 -->

### K. Reference cards

Hand each player a reference card. The cards explain the two Storehouse actions: Decree and War.

<!-- 
The Public Works dial tracks the number of schools, utilities, and public services built in Singapore. Increase the Public Works counter by 1 every time a Public Works card is bought from the Market.
 -->
