# Setup
> **For quick setup, instructions are indented like this.**

## I. Player setup

![Annotated Board](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/annotated_board.jpg?raw=true)

### A. Mini-figure

> **Hand each player a mini-figure.**

There must always be two Malay Chiefs. The player who rolls the highest on a D4 is the First Player this round.

> **On your first game, place each mini-figure on their starting Leader space:**

| Mini-figure | Starting Space |
| :---: | :---: |
| Governor | Market |
| Resident | Market |
| Temenggong | Battle |
| Sultan | Population |

On following games, players may choose where to place their mini-figures, starting with the First Player and going clockwise.

Leader spaces reflect each player's leadership priorities for this round.

After every round (i.e., after every player has taken their turn), the next player clockwise becomes the First Player.

### B. Influence pool

> **Hand each player a pool of colored tokens. Each player places one token at 0 on the Victory Point track.**

These tokens represent Influence. Players place these on Villages (small circles on the congkak Board) to demonstrate their, well---influence---over these Villages.

Influence is added to the board in congkak fashion---one Influence per Village, in a clockwise direction, starting from any Village. When you pass by a Stronghold, you **may** choose to add an Influence to it.

When a Village has five or more Influence tokens on it at the end of an Influence addition, the Village is cleared of tokens in two possible ways:

1. **For points.** British players only get Victory Points from British (blue) Villages being cleared, and similarly Malay players only get Victory Points from Malay (green) Villages being cleared. Players of that faction get one Victory Point for each Influence token of theirs on the Village, multiplied by the Village multiplier. Opponent tokens are returned to opponents.
2. **For stronghold.** Players may opt to forfeit points, and instead transfer all the contents of a Village into their faction Stronghold.

When a Village is cleared, a new ship enters the Port. 

### C. Wealth

> **Hand each player $5. Set the remaining coins near the board---this will be the Bank.**

Wealth represents players' private treasuries.

> *3-player game: the solo player gets $8 to start.*

### D. Battle cards

> **Shuffle each Battle deck and place them face down on the appropriate spaces. Each player draws 2 Battle cards from their faction's deck, keeps 1, and puts the other in a discard pile.**

Battle cards represet the various fighting forces at each faction's disposal. British and Malay players enlist fighters from different Battle decks.

> *3-player game: the solo player draws 3 Battle cards and keeps 2.*

### E. Private Objectives

> **Shuffle each faction's Private Objectives deck. Each player draws 4 cards from their faction's deck, keeps 2, and discards the rest face down.**

Though all players have a stake in the development of Singapore, each player also has their own ideologies and private agendas. Private Objectives may cause players within the same faction to be at odds: one British Agent may want to abolish Opium Farms, but the other wants to keep them as a source of tax revenue.

Players may reveal Private Objectives and claim associated Victory Points as soon as the condition is met. Some Private Objectives can be fulfilled at the end of a turn or round. Others can only be fulfilled at endgame.

## II. Board setup

### F. Villages

> **Cover the x2 and x3 Villages with four black markers.**

The six circles on the congkak board represent Villages that each faction can win over, three per faction. Each faction starts with one available Village---factions must Populate the second and third Villages to unlock them.

Winning over these unlockable Villages yields x2 and x3 Victory Points, respectively. But as more Villages are unlocked, costs of Upkeep also rise!

> *3-player game: the solo player only covers their x3 Village.*

### G. Strongholds

> **Each player places an Influence token in their faction's Stronghold.**

The large circles at the ends of the congkak board represent faction strongholds. At the end of the game, factions split their pot of Influence between players, and add a corresponding number of Victory Points.

### H. Port track

> **Place two Ships on the leftmost space of the Port track, and the rest on the appropriate space.**

Every time a Village is won over, Singapore's prosperity rises, and another Ship arrives in Singapore (i.e., occupies a Port space.)

### I. Immigrants

> **Shuffle the Immigrant deck and place it face down on the appropriate space.**

Immigrant cards represent the various social groups who migrated---voluntarily or otherwise---into Singapore. Immigrant cards yield Population cubes, which are used to unlock Villages.

The black marker covering a Village may only be removed once all the Population spaces underneath it have been filled. When a **sixth** Population cube is placed on a Population space, the space is filled.

Every time a Village is unlocked, the black marker moves to cover the next leftmost circle on the Multiplier track.

<!-- 
### J. Public Works dial

> **Place the Public Works dial on the board and set it to 0.**

The Public Works dial tracks the number of schools, utilities, and public services built in Singapore. Increase the Public Works counter by 1 every time a Public Works card is bought from the Market.
 -->

### J. Treaty space

> **Place the Singapore Treaty face up on the Treaty space.**

The British Agents and Malay Chiefs are initially allied together against their common rivals, the Dutch and the Bugis. This alliance was cemented by the Singapore Treaty of 1819.

While the Singapore Treaty is in effect, players may earn no more than $4 from War.

However, in 1824, the Treaty of London makes peace between the Dutch and the British Agents, who no longer need to appease the Malay Chiefs. When the Treaty of London Event card is drawn, replace the Singapore Treaty with the Treaty of London.

### K. Event deck

> **Set aside the Treaty of London. Create three piles of 2 event cards, face down. Shuffle the Treaty of London into the middle pile, then sandwich this pile between the other two. Place the 7-card stack on the Events deck space, and put the rest of the Event cards away.**

Event cards represent crises, global events, or shifting mores in local society that affect the political status quo. At the start of each round (except the first), a new Event card is revealed.

### L. Market deck

> **Shuffle the Market deck and place it face down on the appropriate space. Deal the first five cards onto the Market, face up.**
