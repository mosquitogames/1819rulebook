## Player Setup

### A. Boards, Leader cards and mini-figures

Hand each player a board and corresponding Leader card. Have players on the same faction sit beside each other. For your first game, use the illustrated side of the board and place the corresponding mini-figures on their starting Leader spaces:

| Mini-figure | Starting Leader space |
| :---: | :---: |
| Governor | Emporium |
| Resident | Emporium |
| Temenggong | Battle |
| Sultan | Population |

Leader spaces reflect players' priorities for the round.

### B. Legacy and Attribute tiles

For your first game, use the Legacies and Attributes printed on the player boards. Put the Legacy and Attribute tiles away.

Otherwise, have each player draw three Legacy tiles at random, keep two, and discard the other. Also have each player draw an Attribute tile at random. Put the rest of the tiles away.

### C. Player tokens

Hand each player a set of colored tokens. Have each player place one token in their faction's Storehouse, and another on the zero space of the Victory Point track.

On the board, player tokens represent Influence. Filling Districts with Influence earns you VPs. Spending Influence from your faction Storehouse lets you issue Decrees or declare War. Off the board, player tokens are also used as trackers for Legacies and the like.

## Board Setup

### D. Districts

Cover the x2 and x3 Districts with the four black markers. These Districts are empty; they must be Populated before players can place Influence tokens on them.

<!-- > *3-player game: the solo player only covers their x3 District.* -->

### E. Port track

Place two Ships on the leftmost space of the Port track, and the rest on the appropriate space. Every time a District is filled with Influence, another Ship arrives in Singapore, occupying another space on the Port track.

## Card Setup

### F. Event cards

Separate the Event cards by their backs: Event I, Event II, and the Treaties.

- Shuffle the Event II cards, then deal three face down onto the Event deck space.
- Place the Treaty of London face down on top of the Event II cards.
- Then shuffle the Event I cards and deal three face down on top of the Treaty.
- Finally, place the Singapore Treaty face down on the pile.

Put the rest of the Event cards away.

### G. Emporium cards

Shuffle the Emporium deck and place it face down on the appropriate space. Deal the first five cards face up onto the Emporium from right to left.

### H. Population cards

Shuffle the Population deck and place it face down on the appropriate space. Population cards yield Population cubes, which unlock higher-scoring Districts.

<!-- 
switch back to IMMIGRANT card
represent the various social groups who migrated---voluntarily or otherwise---into Singapore.
 -->

### I. Battle cards

Shuffle each faction's Battle deck and place them face down on the appropriate spaces. Have each player draw one card from their faction deck.

<!-- 
Battle cards represet the various fighting forces at each faction's disposal. British and Malay players enlist fighters from different Battle decks.

> *3-player game: the solo player draws 3 Battle cards and keeps 2.*
 -->

### J. Reference cards

Hand each player a reference card. The cards explain the two Storehouse actions: Decree and War.
