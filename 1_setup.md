# Setup

This setup is for Fantasy Mode. We recommend your first game be in Fantasy Mode. To set up Simulation Mode, follow steps A to H below, then carry out the modified steps [here](/1819rulebook/simulation-mode#setup-changes).

## Player Setup

![Main Board setup](/img/main_board_setup.jpg)

### A. Boards, Leader cards and mini-figures

Hand each player a board and corresponding Leader card. Players on the same faction sit beside each other. For your first game, use the illustrated side of the player board and place the corresponding mini-figures on their starting Leader spaces:

| Mini-figure | Starting Leader space |
| :---: | :---: |
| Governor | Market |
| Resident | Market |
| Temenggong | Battle |
| Sultan | Population |

Leader spaces give players Leader Actions that reflect their priorities for the round.

### B. Legacy and Attribute tiles
<!-- Legacies are the achievements your character wants history to remember them for, while Attributes allow them to bend the rules *(ever so slightly)* in their favor. -->

For your first game, use the Legacies and Attributes printed on the player boards. Put the Legacy and Attribute tiles away.

Otherwise, have each player draw 3 Legacy tiles at random, keep 2, and discard the other. Also have each player draw 1 Attribute tile at random. Put the rest of the tiles away.

### C. Player tokens

Hand each player a set of colored tokens. Have each player place 1 token on the zero space of the Victory Point track.

On the board, player tokens represent Influence. Filling Districts with Influence earns you VPs. Spending Influence from your faction Storehouse lets you issue Decrees or declare War.

Off the board, player tokens are also used as trackers for Legacies and the like.

### D. First Player token

Hand the player who rolls the highest the First Player token.

## Board Setup

### E. Districts

Cover the x2 and x3 Districts with the four black markers. These Districts are closed; they must be Populated before players can place Influence tokens on them.

<!-- > *3-player game: the solo player only covers their x3 District.* -->
<!-- ## Card Setup -->

### F. Event cards

Separate the Event cards by their backs: Event I, Event II, and the Treaties.

- Shuffle the Event II cards, then deal 3 face down onto the Event deck space.
- Place the Treaty of London face down on top of the Event II cards.
- Then shuffle the Event I cards and deal 3 face down on top of the Treaty.
- Finally, place the Singapore Treaty face down on the pile.

Put the rest of the Event cards away.

### G. Market cards

Shuffle the Market deck and place it face down on the appropriate space. Deal the first 5 cards face up onto the Market from right to left.

### H. Population cards

Shuffle the Population deck and place it face down on the appropriate space. Population cards yield Population cubes, which unlock higher-scoring Districts.

<!-- 
represent the various social groups who migrated---voluntarily or otherwise---into Singapore.
 -->

### I. Battle cards

Shuffle each faction's Battle deck and place them face down on the appropriate spaces. Have each player draw 1 card from their faction deck.

<!-- 
> *3-player game: the solo player draws 3 Battle cards and keeps 2.*
 -->

## Setup is complete!
