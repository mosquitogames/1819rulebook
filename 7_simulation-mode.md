# Simulation Mode

## Setup
Follow [the usual setup](/1819rulebook/setup) until step H, then:

### H. Battle cards
Put away the Mythic Battle cards.

Shuffle the remaining Malay Battle cards and place them face down on the appropriate space. Have each Raja draw 1 card.

Set aside the four ships from the British Battle deck. Shuffle the remaining cards. Have each Agent draw 1 card. Shuffle the four ships back in, and place the British Battle cards face down on the appropriate space.

### I. Role cards

Hand each Raja a set of Role cards --- a Colonial Ally card and a Resistance Leader card. Hand each Agent a Colonial Ruler Role card for reference.

### J. Folk Hero deck

Shuffle the Folk Hero deck and place it face down near the board.

## Sequence of Play Changes
1. When the Anglo-Dutch Treaty is revealed, Malay players must simultaneously declare their alignment by turning one of their Role cards face up. Alignments may not be changed later.

## Raja Roles
Rajas must declare their allegiance by revealing one of the two Role cards, after which the following rule modifiers apply:

### Colonial Ally
1. Gain **+$2 more Income**.
2. You may **Declare War** on any player, but decrease the Spoils of War Multiplier by 2 *(minimum x1)*.
3. You may only **Join Wars** against Resistance Leaders.
3. Your Influence tokens in **British Districts** now generate VPs.
4. You may now only access the **British Storehouse**. If all Agents agree, they may veto your use of the British Storehouse.

### Resistance Leader
1. **New Action: Inspire.** Spend 5 tokens from your Storehouse to draw a **Folk Hero** card.
2. When **victorious** in War against **at least one Agent**, increase the Spoils of War Multiplier by 5.
3. When **defeated** in War, draw 2 Folk Hero cards, keep 1, and discard the other.

## Agent Role
The Agents play by modified rules fitting for their new role:

### Colonial Ruler
1. When victorious in War against at least one **Colonial Ally**, decrease the Spoils of War Multiplier by 2 *(minimum x1)*.
2. When **defeated** in War by at least one **Resistance Leader**, you may immediately purchase a **Battle Card**, if you can afford it.
3. If all Agents agree, you may veto **Colonial Allies'** use of the British Storehouse.
