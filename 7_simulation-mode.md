# Simulation Mode
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Setup
Follow [the usual setup](/setup) until step H, then:

### H. Battle cards
{: .no_toc }
Put away the Mythic Battle cards.

Shuffle the remaining Malay Battle cards and place them face down on the appropriate space. Have each Raja draw 1 card.

Set aside the four ships from the British Battle deck. Shuffle the remaining cards. Have each Agent draw 1 card. Shuffle the four ships back in, and place the British Battle cards face down on the appropriate space.

### I. Role cards
{: .no_toc }
Hand each Raja a set of Role cards --- a Colonial Ally card and a Resistance Leader card. Hand each Agent a Colonial Ruler Role card for reference.

### J. Folk Hero deck
{: .no_toc }
Shuffle the Folk Hero deck and place it face down near the board.

## Declaring Roles
When the Anglo-Dutch Treaty is revealed, Rajas must choose whether to become a Colonial Ally or a Resistance Leader for the remainder of the game.

Rajas may confer briefly, before simultaneously declaring their Roles by revealing their chosen Role card. **Roles may not be changed later!**

## Raja Roles
Rajas must declare their allegiance by revealing one of the two Role cards, after which the following rule modifiers apply:

### Colonial Ally
1. Gain **+$2 more Income**.
2. You may purchase dual-cost Market cards at their British cost +$1.
3. Your Influence tokens in **British Districts** now generate VPs.
4. You may no longer **Declare** or **Join** Wars.
5. You may now **only** access the **British Storehouse**.
    - However, if all Agents agree, they may veto your use of the British Storehouse.

### Resistance Leader
1. **New Action**: Spend 4 tokens from your Storehouse to draw a **Folk Hero** card.
2. Wars against **Agents**:
    - Victory: +5 to Spoils of War Multiplier.
    - Loss: draw a **Folk Hero card** (draw two if outnumbered by opponents).
4. Wars against **Colonial Allies**: -1 to Spoils of War Multiplier.
5. If you are the **only** Resistance Leader, add one additional token every time you place tokens in your Storehouse.

> *Example.* The Sultan is a Resistance Leader. He declares War on the Resident and is victorious by a margin of 2. The Multiplier is at \\(\times 2\\). The Sultan therefore claims \\(2 \times (2 + 5) = 14\\) VPs.

## Agent Role
The Agents play by modified rules fitting for their new role:

### Colonial Ruler
{: .no_toc }
1. Wars against **Colonial Allies**: -2 to Spoils of War Multiplier.
2. Wars against **Resistance Leaders**:
    - Victory: no modifier to Multiplier. Resistance Leaders draw Folk Hero cards.
    - Loss: immediately Buy a Battle card, if you can afford it.
3. If all Agents agree, you may veto **Colonial Allies'** use of the British Storehouse.
