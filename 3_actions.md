- Any **instant effect/s** or **card type/s** are in the upper right corner. They are resolved **top to bottom**.
- Any **passive effects** are explained in **bold**.

## Populate
Players draw the top card of the Immigrant deck.

Any instant effects (in the upper right) are resolved immediately, from top to bottom.

Players must anchor Immigrant cards to Immigrant attachments on certain Market cards. When cards Immigrants are attached to are discarded or flipped over, Immigrants may be reassigned to other free slots where available. Where none are available, Immigrants turn to crime. Discard the unmoored cards and lose 1 Victory Point per card.

Players may receive endgame Victory Point bonuses from collecting sets.

## Use
Use Market cards or linked groups of Market cards. Take all actions listed at the bottom of the card/s. Each card or linked group of cards may only be used once per round.

<!-- 
Some actions are linked and must be done together. Some actions are linked to the Chain icon, meaning that using that action triggers the same action on all identical cards in a player's tableau. Players may not trigger the same Chain more than once per turn.
 -->

| Symbol | Card action |

 -->

<!-- 
## Discard
Players may discard:
- their own Resource, Immigrant, or Battle card, at no cost;
- an opponent's Resource or Immigrant card at face value;
- all cards in the Market, at the most expensive Market card's face value;

where "face value" means the price relevant to the discarding player's faction, ignoring any passive effects. All costs are paid to the Bank.
 -->

## Raid

<!-- *Raiding gives your wealth a quick boost, but scares traders away.* -->

Roll one die and gain that many dollars ("$1D"). If the result is more than 0, remove one ship from the Port track.

## Decree
Some info here.

## Declare War

<!-- *Declare War to corner your opponents and drain their resources.* -->

Players may only declare War on players in the **enemy faction**. They must choose which player to target.

The attacker and their target (i.e., the defender) each commit one Battle card (if available). Their faction mates may opt to assist them by committing one additional Battle card. 

The attacker and defender may each withdraw as many tokens from their respective faction Storehouses as they wish. Each token counts as 1 Strength.

The attacker and defender each roll two dice.

<!-- > **3-player game: the solo player may commit 2 battle cards.** -->

Whoever has the higher total Strength (Battle card/s + Storehouse tokens + D4) wins the War, with the attacker winning ties. Revealed Battle cards are discarded.

The winner of War plunders the loser for $ (Total strength point difference) x (Active multiplier). If the loser has Wealth, the winner must take that Wealth. The loser's ally may choose to donate Wealth, which the winner must also take.

However, if the proffered Wealth is insufficient, the winner may:
- steal the loser's Market cards (worth the price relevant to the winner). Winners may not take Market cards worth more than the amount they are owed. Immigrants attached to the Market card stay with the loser, who may reassign or discard them at their discretion.
- gain (**not** steal) Victory Points (worth $1 each).

Because War is destabilizing, a ship is removed from the Port.
