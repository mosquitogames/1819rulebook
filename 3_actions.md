# Actions
Players usually take 2 actions per turn.

## Buy
Players use their own Wealth to purchase Market cards or Battle cards.

The price of a Market card is in the upper left corner; some cards have distinct prices for the British Agents (blue) and for the Malay Chiefs (green). When a card is taken from the Market, a new card is **immediately drawn** to replace it.

Battle cards cost $2. Players draw a card from their faction's Battle deck. Players pay the Bank $2 to draw a card from their faction's Battle deck. The card's Strength is indicated in the upper right corner.

Players may discard Market or Battle cards at no cost, anytime during their turn. When a Market card that is discarded had Immigrants attached, the player may reallocate these Immigrants to other available spaces, otherwise discard them at a loss of 1 Victory Point each.

- Any **instant effect/s** or **card type/s** are in the upper right corner. They are resolved **top to bottom**.
- Any **passive effects** are explained in **bold**.
- Any **card actions** are in the bottom right corner.

| Symbol | Instant effect / card type |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Add Influence](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/influence.png?raw=true) | Add specified number of Influence tokens to congkak board |
| ![Add Immigrants](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/immigrants.png?raw=true) | Add specified number of Immigrant cubes to Population space |
| ![Swap Objective](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/private_objectives.png?raw=true) | Swap out one Private Objective (draw 2, keep 1) at no cost |
| ![Public Work](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/public_works.png?raw=true) | Public Works card --- Add your token to the Public Works track |
| ![Tax](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/tax.png?raw=true) | Tax card -- Add your token to the Tax track |
| ![Vice](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/vice.png?raw=true) | Vice card -- Add Vice token to Stronghold |

## Populate
Players draw an Immigrant card from the deck.

Any instant effects (in the upper right) are resolved immediately from top to bottom.

Players must anchor Immigrant cards to Immigrant attachments on certain Market cards. When cards Immigrants are attached to are discarded or flipped over, Immigrants may be reassigned to other free slots where available. Where none are available, Immigrants turn to crime. Discard the unmoored cards and lose 1 Victory Point per card.

Players may receive endgame Victory Point bonuses from collecting sets.

## Use
Use Market cards or linked groups of Market cards. Take all actions listed at the bottom of the card/s. Each card or linked group of cards may only be used once per round.

<!-- 
Some actions are linked and must be done together. Some actions are linked to the Chain icon, meaning that using that action triggers the same action on all identical cards in a player's tableau. Players may not trigger the same Chain more than once per turn.
 -->

| Symbol | Card action |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Add Influence](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/influence.png?raw=true) | Add specified number of Influence tokens to congkak board |
| ![Add Immigrants](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/immigrants.png?raw=true) | Add specified number of Immigrant cubes to Population space |
| ![Add Wealth](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/wealth.png?raw=true) | Add specified amount to Wealth |

<!-- 
![Conflict](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/conflict.png?raw=true) | Engage in conflict (Raid, Intervene, Battle) |
| ![Chain](https://github.com/mosquitogames/1819rulebook/blob/main/img/chain.png?raw=true) | Chain action |
 -->

<!-- 
## Discard
Players may discard:
- their own Resource, Immigrant, or Battle card, at no cost;
- an opponent's Resource or Immigrant card at face value;
- all cards in the Market, at the most expensive Market card's face value;

where "face value" means the price relevant to the discarding player's faction, ignoring any passive effects. All costs are paid to the Bank.
 -->

## Raid
Players may go **Raiding**, which boosts players' Wealth if successful, but damages the opponent's reputation.

When Malay Chiefs go Raiding, British Agents prefer to call it *piracy*.

When British Agents go Raiding, Malay Chiefs prefer to call it *plunder*.

To go Raiding, players roll two D4s, then take from the Bank that dollar amount.

Raiding scares off traders. Remove one ship from the Port.

### Intervene
When a player goes **Raiding**, any other player may choose to **Intervene**. Interventions do not count as actions. Only one player may Intervene; if multiple players wish to Intervene, the next clockwise player from the active player has priority.

Interventions must be declared before the Raider rolls the dice.

To Intervene, commit a single Battle card. **Identical Battle cards may be played together as if they were one card.**

If the Interventionist **matches or exceeds** the Raider's roll, the Intervention is successful. They place two of their Influence tokens onto the board. Interventionists win ties.

Whether or not an Intervention was successful, the altercation scared off traders. Remove one ship from the Port.

## Declare War
Whereas players go on Raids primarily to gain Wealth, players declare War to corner their opponents and drain their resources. Players may only declare War on players in the **enemy faction**. They must choose which player to target.

**War costs 2 turns.**

The attacker and their target (i.e., the defender) each commit one Battle card (if available). Their faction mates may opt to assist them by committing one additional Battle card. 

**Identical Battle cards may be played together as if they were one card.**

The attacker and defender may each withdraw as many tokens from their respective faction Strongholds as they wish. Each token counts as 1 Strength.

The attacker and defender each roll a D4.

> **3-player game: the solo player may commit 2 battle cards.**

Whoever has the higher total Strength (Battle card/s + Stronghold tokens + D4) wins the War, with the attacker winning ties. Revealed Battle cards are discarded.

The winner of War plunders the loser for $ (Total strength point difference) x (Active multiplier). If the loser has Wealth, the winner must take that Wealth. The loser's ally may choose to donate Wealth, which the winner must also take.

However, if the proffered Wealth is insufficient, the winner may:
- steal the loser's Market cards (worth the price relevant to the winner). Winners may not take Market cards worth more than the amount they are owed. Immigrants attached to the Market card stay with the loser, who may reassign or discard them at their discretion.
- gain (**not** steal) Victory Points (worth $1 each).

Because War is destabilizing, a ship is removed from the Port.
