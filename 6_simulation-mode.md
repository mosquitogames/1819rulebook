# Simulation Mode

## Setup Changes
1. Remove Mythic cards from the Malay battle deck.
2. Hand each Malay Chief two Role cards --- Colonial Ally and Resistance Leader --- face down.
3. Hand each British Agent a Colonial Ruler Role card.
4. Shuffle the Folk Hero deck and place it face down near the board.

## Sequence of Play Changes
1. When the Treaty of London is revealed, Malay players must simultaneously declare their alignment by turning one of their Role cards face up. Alignments may not be changed later.

## Malay Chief Roles
Malay Chiefs must declare their allegiance by revealing one of the two Role cards, after which the following rule modifiers apply:

### Colonial Ally
1. Gain **+$2 Income** during the Income Phase.
2. You may **Declare War** on any player, but decrease the Spoils of War Multiplier by 2 *(minimum x1)*.
3. You may only **Join Wars** against Resistance Leaders.
3. Your Influence tokens in **British Districts** now generate VPs.
4. You may now only access the **British Storehouse**. If all British Agents agree, they may veto your use of the British Storehouse.

### Resistance Leader
1. **New Action: Inspire.** Spend 5 tokens from your Storehouse to draw a **Folk Hero** card.
2. When **victorious** in War against **at least one British Agent**, increase the Spoils of War Multiplier by 5.
3. When **defeated** in War, draw 2 Folk Hero cards, keep 1, and discard the other.

## British Agent Role
The British Agents play by modified rules fitting for their new role:

### Colonial Ruler
1. When victorious in War against at least one **Colonial Ally**, decrease the Spoils of War Multiplier by 2 *(minimum x1)*.
2. When **defeated** in War by at least one **Resistance Leader**, you may immediately purchase a **Battle Card**, if you can afford it.
3. If all British Agents agree, you may veto **Colonial Allies'** use of the British Storehouse.
