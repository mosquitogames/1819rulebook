## Game Flow

1819 Singapore is played over a series of eight rounds or fewer. Each round has four phases:
1. [Event phase](#1-event-phase)
2. [Leader phase](#2-leader-phase)
3. [Action phase](#3-action-phase)
4. [Upkeep phase](#4-upkeep-phase)

In the **Event** phase, players draw and collectively resolve an Event card. In the **Leader** phase, players decide on their priorities for the round. In the **Action** phase, players take two actions each, going clockwise from the First Player. Finally, in the **Upkeep** phase, players collectively meet the cost of maintaining Singapore.
<!-- ---crises, global events, or shifting social mores that affect the rulers' status quo. -->

## Endgame Conditions

The game ends when, at the **end** of a round,

- there are no Event cards left; or
- all ships are on the Port track, i.e., Singapore prospers; or
- no ships are left, i.e., Singapore collapses.

## 1. Event phase

Reveal the top card of the Event deck and place it on the Event space.
- In the first round, reveal the Singapore Treaty and place it on the Treaty space.
- **Immediate (⚡)️ Events** must be resolved before proceeding.

## 2. Leader phase

### a. Assign First Player
- In the first round, hand the player who rolls the highest the First Player token.
- In succeeding rounds, pass the token to the next (clockwise) player.

### b. Distribute Income
- In the first round, hand each player $5.
- In succeeding rounds, hand each player the amount specified by the highest Port space with a ship on it.

### c. Place Leaders
Place your mini-figure on an open Leader space, starting with the First Player. The Leader space gives you a Free Action you may use this round. *(On your first game, your starting Priorities are decided for you.)*

## 3. Action phase
Play proceeds from the First Player. On your turn, take two core Actions, and any free Actions, in any order. The 6 Core Actions are:

- **Buy** an Emporium or Battle card
- **Populate** Singapore with a Population card
- **Activate** a card or community
- Go on a **Raid**
- Issue a **Decree**
- Declare **War** *(counts as two Actions)*

Free Actions may only be taken once. Core Actions may be taken twice. You need not take all your Actions.

Actions are explained in detail in [the next section](/actions).

<!-- *3-player game: the solo player takes 3 actions per turn.* -->

## 4. Upkeep phase

### a. Pay for Public Works
All players receive 1 VP per Tax token on the board.

If Public Works \\(\leq\\) Tax, Upkeep is met! The players with the most Tax tokens on the track receive 2 VPs per token.

If Public Works \\(\>\\) Tax, Upkeep is failed. All players who own unfunded Public Works (i.e., Public Works tokens in excess of the Tax tokens) must pay **$ Upkeep Multiplier** per Work.

If you cannot afford to fund your Public Work, you must:
1. flip over a Public Works card in your tableau,
2. remove associated Public Work tokens from the board,
3. discard any attached Population cards, and
4. remove the corresponding number of Population cubes from the board.

Face-down Public Works cannot be Activated. On your turn, you may flip a face-down card back up by paying its price as a free Action. See [Flipping cards](/concepts#flipping-cards).

### b. Flush the Emporium
Discard the rightmost Emporium card. Shift the other cards one space to the right, then draw the top card of the Emporium deck to fill the leftmost space.
