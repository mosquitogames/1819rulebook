## Game Flow

1819 Singapore is played over a series of eight rounds or fewer. Each round has four phases:
1. [Event phase](#1-event-phase) --- *face new crises and opportunities;*
2. [Income phase](#2-income-phase) --- *receive royal income;*
3. [Action phase](#3-action-phase) --- *take turns clockwise from the First Player;*
4. [Upkeep](#4-upkeep-phase) --- *meet the cost of maintaining Singapore and prepare for the next round.*

## 1. Event phase

In the first round, reveal the Singapore Treaty, place it on the Treaty space, and place two Ships on the Port track.

In succeeding rounds, reveal the top Event card and place it on the Event space. Resolve any instant effects before proceeding. See [Events](/1819rulebook/events).

## 2. Income phase

### a. Assign First Player
- In the first round, hand the player who rolls the highest the First Player token.
- In succeeding rounds, pass the token to the next (clockwise) player.

### b. Distribute Income
- In the first round, hand each player $3.
- In succeeding rounds, distribute resources as specified by the highest occupied Port space.

> *Example.* There are four Ships on the Port track. Hand each player $3, and place one Neutral token in each Storehouse.

## 3. Action phase
Play proceeds clockwise from the First Player. On your turn, do the following:

### a. Place Leader
Place your mini-figure on an open Leader space. Take the indicated Leader Action, if feasible and desired. Leader Actions **may not be taken later**!

### b. Take two Actions and any Free Actions
The Core Actions are:

- **Buy** a Market or Battle card
- **Populate** Singapore with a Population card
- **Activate** a card or community
- Go on a **Raid**
- Issue a **Decree**
- Declare **War** *(counts as two Actions)*

See [Core Actions](/1819rulebook/actions). 

Other Actions may become available to you as the game progresses. The same Action may be taken twice, unless otherwise specified.

**Free Actions.** Free Actions may become available to you as the game progresses. You may take Free Actions anytime on your turn.

![Leader space](/img/leader_space.jpg)

> *Example.* You are the <span style="color:blue"><strong>Blue</strong></span> player. You can't afford a Battle card, so for your Leader Action, you place one token in your Storehouse. You then issue a Decree and go on a Raid. Your turn ends.

<!-- *3-player game: the solo player takes 3 actions per turn.* -->

## 4. Upkeep phase

### a. Pay for Public Works
All players receive 1 VP per Tax token on the board.

If Public Works \\(\leq\\) Tax, Upkeep is met! The player with the most Tax tokens on the track receives 1 additional VP per token. In case of a tie, all leading players receive the bonus.

If Public Works \\(\>\\) Tax, Upkeep is failed. All players still receive 1 VP per Tax token. Each player who owns Public Work tokens in excess of the Tax tokens must either **Fund** or **Close** their excess Public Works. See [Excess Public Works](/1819rulebook/important-concepts#excess-public-works).

![Successful Upkeep](/img/upkeep_successful.jpg)

> *Example.* There are 5 Tax tokens and 2 Public Works tokens, so Upkeep is met. The <span style="color:magenta"><strong>Purple</strong></span> player receives 1 VP. Both the <span style="color:blue"><strong>Blue</strong></span> and <span style="color:red"><strong>Red</strong></span> players have the most Tax tokens. They each receive 2 tokens \\(\times\\) 2 VPs = 4 VPs.

### b. Remove Leaders from Leader spaces.

### c. If there are no Ships in the Port, turn the Dutch token face up.
- While the Dutch token is face up, ignore instructions to remove Ships.
- When a Ship enters the Port, flip the Dutch token face down.
- If by the end of next round, the Dutch token is still face up, the game ends.

### d. Flush the Market
Discard the rightmost Market card. Shift the other cards one space to the right, then draw the top card of the Market deck to fill the leftmost space.
