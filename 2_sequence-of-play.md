## Game Flow

1819 Singapore is played over a series of eight rounds or fewer. Each round has four phases:
1. [Event phase](#1-event-phase)
2. [Income phase](#2-income-phase)
3. [Action phase](#3-action-phase)
4. [Upkeep phase](#4-upkeep-phase)

In the **Event** phase, players draw and collectively resolve an Event card. In the **Income** phase, players receive income. In the **Action** phase, players take a Leader action and two core actions each, going clockwise from the First Player. In the **Upkeep** phase, players collectively meet the cost of maintaining Singapore, and prepare for the next round.

<!-- ---crises, global events, or shifting social mores that affect the rulers' status quo. -->

## Endgame Conditions

The game ends when, at the **end** of a round,

- there are no Event cards left; or
<!-- - all ships are on the Port track, i.e., Singapore prospers; or -->
- no ships are left, i.e., Singapore collapses.

## 1. Event phase

Reveal the top card of the Event deck and place it on the Event space.
- In the first round, reveal the Singapore Treaty and place it on the Treaty space.
- **Immediate (⚡)️ Events** must be resolved before proceeding.

## 2. Income phase

### a. Assign First Player
- In the first round, hand the player who rolls the highest the First Player token.
- In succeeding rounds, pass the token to the next (clockwise) player.

### b. Distribute Income
- In the first round, hand each player $3.
- In succeeding rounds, hand each player the amount specified by the highest Port space with a ship on it.

## 3. Action phase
Play proceeds from the First Player. On your turn, do the following:

### a. Place Leader
Place your mini-figure on an open Leader space. Take the indicated Leader Action, if desired. Leader Actions **may not** be taken later!

### b. Take two Core Actions
The Core Actions are:

- **Buy** a Market or Battle card
- **Populate** Singapore with a Population card
- **Activate** a card or community
- Go on a **Raid**
- Issue a **Decree**
- Declare **War** *(counts as two Actions)*

The same Core Action may be taken twice.

Actions are explained in detail in [the next section](/actions).

![Leader space](/img/leader_space.jpg)

> *Example.* You are the <span style="color:blue"><strong>Blue</strong></span> player. For your two Core Actions this round, you Buy a Battle card and issue a Decree. Thanks to the Leader space you are on, you pay $1 in order to Populate as a third, free Action.

<!-- *3-player game: the solo player takes 3 actions per turn.* -->

## 4. Upkeep phase

### a. Pay for Public Works
All players receive 1 VP per Tax token on the board.

If Public Works \\(\leq\\) Tax, Upkeep is met! The players with the most Tax tokens on the track receive 2 VPs per token.

If Public Works \\(\>\\) Tax, Upkeep is failed. All players still receive 1 VP per Tax token of theirs. All players who own Public Work tokens in excess of the Tax tokens must pay **$ Upkeep Multiplier** (the leftmost open value on the Multiplier track) per Work.

![Upkeep](/img/upkeep_example.jpg)

> *Example.* There are 4 Tax tokens and 6 Public Works tokens, so Upkeep is failed. The <span style="color:blue"><strong>Blue</strong></span> and <span style="color:magenta"><strong>Purple</strong></span> players each have an unfunded Public Work. They must each pay 1 token \\(\times\\) Upkeep Multiplier of 2 = $2.

If you **cannot afford** to fund your Public Work, you must:
1. flip over a Public Works card in your tableau,
2. remove associated Public Work tokens from the board,
3. discard any attached Population cards, and
4. remove the corresponding number of Population cubes from the board.

Face-down Public Works cannot be Activated. On your turn, you may flip a face-down card back up by paying its price as a free Action. See [Flipping cards](/important-concepts#flipping-cards).

### b. Remove Leaders from Leader spaces.

### c. Flush the Market
Discard the rightmost Market card. Shift the other cards one space to the right, then draw the top card of the Market deck to fill the leftmost space.
