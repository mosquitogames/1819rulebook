## Game Flow

1819 Singapore is played over a series of eight rounds or fewer. Each round has four phases:
1. [Event phase](#1-event-phase) --- *face new crises and opportunities;*
2. [Income phase](#2-income-phase) --- *receive royal income;*
3. [Action phase](#3-action-phase) --- *take turns clockwise from the First Player;*
4. [Upkeep](#4-upkeep-phase) --- *meet the cost of maintaining Singapore and prepare for the next round.*

## 1. Event phase

In the first round, reveal the Singapore Treaty, place it on the Treaty space, and place two Ships on the Port track.
<!-- - Roll one die (1D) and add that many Ships to the Port track. -->

In succeeding rounds, reveal the top Event card and place it on the Event space. Resolve any instant effects before proceeding. See [Events](/1819rulebook/events).

<!-- - If the Event is an **Immediate (⚡)️ Event** must be resolved before proceeding. -->

## 2. Income phase

### a. Assign First Player
- In the first round, hand the player who rolls the highest the First Player token.
- In succeeding rounds, pass the token to the next (clockwise) player.

### b. Distribute Income
- In the first round, hand each player $3.
- In succeeding rounds, distribute resources as specified by the highest Port space occupied by a Ship.

<!-- hand each player the amount specified by the highest Port space with a Ship on it. -->

<!-- EXAMPLE HERE -->

## 3. Action phase
Play proceeds clockwise from the First Player. On your turn, do the following:

### a. Place Leader
Place your mini-figure on an open Leader space. Take the indicated Leader Action, if feasible and desired. Leader Actions **may not be taken later**!

### b. Take two Actions and any Free Actions
The Core Actions are:

- **Buy** a Market or Battle card
- **Populate** Singapore with a Population card
- **Activate** a card or community
- Go on a **Raid**
- Issue a **Decree**
- Declare **War** *(counts as two Actions)*

See [Core Actions](/1819rulebook/actions). 

Other Actions may become available to you as the game progresses. The same Action may be taken twice, unless otherwise specified.

**Free Actions.** Free Actions may become available to you as the game progresses. You may take Free Actions anytime on your turn.

> *Example.* You are the <span style="color:blue"><strong>Blue</strong></span> player. For your two Core Actions this round, you Buy a Battle card and issue a Decree. Thanks to the Leader space you are on, you pay $1 in order to Populate as a third, free Action.

<!-- *3-player game: the solo player takes 3 actions per turn.* -->

## 4. Upkeep phase

### a. Pay for Public Works
All players receive 1 VP per Tax token on the board.

If Public Works \\(\leq\\) Tax, Upkeep is met! The player with the most Tax tokens on the track receives 1 additional VP per token. In case of a tie, all leading players receive the bonus.

If Public Works \\(\>\\) Tax, Upkeep is failed. All players still receive 1 VP per Tax token of theirs. Each player who owns Public Work tokens in excess of the Tax tokens must pay **$1 \\(\times\\) Upkeep Multiplier per excess Public Work**, where the Upkeep Multiplier is the leftmost open value on the Multiplier track.

![Upkeep](/img/upkeep_example.jpg)

> *Example.* There are 4 Tax tokens and 6 Public Works tokens, so Upkeep is failed. The <span style="color:blue"><strong>Blue</strong></span> and <span style="color:magenta"><strong>Purple</strong></span> players each have an excess Public Work. They must each pay 1 token \\(\times\\) Upkeep Multiplier of 2 = $2.

If you **cannot afford** to fund your excess Public Works, you must **Close** them. See [Closing Public Works](/1819rulebook/important-concepts#closing-public-works).

### b. Remove Leaders from Leader spaces.

### c. Flush the Market
Discard the rightmost Market card. Shift the other cards one space to the right, then draw the top card of the Market deck to fill the leftmost space.
