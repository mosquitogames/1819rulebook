## Game Flow

1819 Singapore is played over a series of eight rounds or fewer. Each round has four phases:
1. [Event phase](#1-event-phase)
2. [Leader phase](#2-leader-phase)
3. [Action phase](#3-action-phase)
4. [Upkeep phase](#4-upkeep-phase)

In the **Event** phase, players draw and collectively resolve an Event card. In the **Leader** phase, players decide on their priorities for the round. In the **Action** phase, players take two actions each, going clockwise from the First Player. Finally, in the **Upkeep** phase, players collectively meet the cost of maintaining Singapore.

## Endgame Conditions

The game ends when, at the **end** of a round,

- there are no Event cards left; or
- all ships are on the board, i.e., Singapore prospers; or
- no ships are left on the board, i.e., Singapore collapses.

## 1. Event phase

Reveal the top card of the Event deck and place it on the Event space.
- In the first round, reveal the Singapore Treaty and place it on the Treaty space.
- Events marked **Immediate** must be resolved before proceeding.

## 2. Leader phase

### Assign First Player
- In the first round, hand the player who rolls the highest D4 the First Player token.
- In succeeding rounds, pass the token to the next (clockwise) player.

### Distribute Income
- In the first round, hand each player $5.
- In succeeding rounds, hand each player the amount specified by the highest Port space with a ship on it.

### Set Priorities
***(Skip this step on your first game.)*** Place your mini-figure on an open Leader space, starting with the First Player.

## 3. Action phase
On your turn, take two Actions:

- **Buy** a Resource or Battle card
- **Populate** Singapore with an Immigrant card
- **Use** a card from your tableau
- Go on a **Raid**
- Issue a **Decree**
- Declare **War**

Play proceeds from the First Player. You may take the same Action twice. Actions are explained in detail in the next section.

<!-- *3-player game: the solo player takes 3 actions per turn.* -->

## 4. Upkeep phase
Check the Tax and Public Works tracks.

If there are at least as many Tax tokens as Public Works tokens, Upkeep is met!
- All players receive 1 VP per Tax token.
- If one player contributed more Tax tokens than anyone else, that player receives 2 VPs per token.

If there are strictly fewer Tax tokens than Public Works tokens, Upkeep is failed.
- Remove one ship from the Port track. Remember, if the board is cleared of ships, the game ends!
- All players who own unfunded Public Works (i.e., Public Works tokens in excess of the Tax tokens) must pay **$ Upkeep Multiplier** per token.
- If you cannot afford to fund your Public Work, you must flip over the card in your tableau and discard any attached Immigrants. You cannot Use deactivated, face-down cards in your tableau.
- On your turn, you may reactivate a card by paying its market cost to the Bank. This is a free Action.
