## Game Flow
1819 Singapore is played over a series of eight rounds or fewer. The game ends when:

1. there are no more Event cards to draw (i.e., eight rounds have passed);
2. the last (rightmost) Port space is filled with ships, and Singapore prospers;
3. the first (leftmost) Port space is emptied of ships, and Singapore collapses.

When an endgame condition is reached, play continues until that round is over (i.e., until Upkeep is resolved). If the condition still holds, the game ends.

Each round has five phases:


The player who rolls the highest on a D4 is the First Player this round.

After every round (i.e., after every player has taken their turn), the next player clockwise becomes the First Player.


Every round of gameplay progresses in five phases.

## 1. Reveal and resolve an Event card

> **Skip this on the first round.**

Events marked Immediate must be resolved before proceeding to next phase.

Event cards represent crises, global events, or shifting mores in local society that affect the political status quo. At the start of each round (except the first), a new Event card is revealed.

## 2. Place Leader

Remove all mini-figures from the board. Starting with the First Player and going clockwise, players place mini-figures on Leader spaces. Mini-figures may not share a space, or 'bump' a previously-placed mini-figure.

(Skip on the first round, except in the first game).

## 3. Take allowance

> **Skip this on the first round.**

All players take an amount of Wealth from the Bank specified by the rightmost Port space with a ship on it.

## 4. Take 2 actions

Starting with the First Player and going clockwise, players each take up to 2 actions:

- **Buy** a Market or Battle card
- **Populate** Singapore with an Immigrant card
- Go on a **Raid**
- Declare **War**, which **counts as 2 actions**

Generally, players may take the same action twice. Actions are explained in detail in the next section.

*3-player game: the solo player takes 3 actions per turn.*

## 5. Pay for Upkeep
Players must collectively meet the maintenance cost of Public Works. If there are at least as many tokens on the Tax track as the Public Works track, **Upkeep is met**. Players receive 1 Victory Point for each token they have on the Tax track **(TO TEST: x MULTIPLIER?)**.

If there are more tokens on the Public Works track than the Tax track, **Upkeep is not met**. Remove one ship from the Port track. If there are no more ships left on the board, the game ends!

The players who own the "unfunded" Public Works (i.e., the rightmost Public Works without corresponding Tax tokens) must pay the Upkeep Multiplier for each of their tokens.

If players cannot afford the "unfunded" Public Works, they must turn over one of the Public Work cards in their tableau, deactivating it. To reactivate the Public Work, they may take a free action to pay the card's market cost to the Bank.

The next clockwise player becomes the First Player for the next round.
