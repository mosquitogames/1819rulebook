## Decree

Spend 5 tokens of any colour from your Storehouse to **outlaw** or **legalize** a Vice. At the start of the game, all Vices are legal. Vices can be outlawed and legalized repeatedly.

The exception is **Slavery**, which costs 8 tokens to outlaw, and cannot be legalized thereafter.

> *Example.* Gambling and Opium are outlawed, while Slavery, Liquor, and Prostitution are legal.

### Outlaw
When you outlaw a Vice:
1. Place your Player token on the corresponding Vice space on the board.
2. Flip over all such Vice cards in all players' tableaus.
3. Remove the corresponding tokens from the Tax track.
4. Discard any Population cards, as well as their corresponding Population cubes.
5. Discard all such Vice cards, if any, from the Emporium.

If a Vice appears in the Emporium while it is outlawed, **discard it immediately** and replace it with the next card.

### Legalize
When you legalize an outlawed Vice:
1. Remove the Player token from the corresponding Vice space on the board.
2. Flip back all face-down Vices of that type.
3. Place tokens back on the Tax track.

Legalization does **not** restore discarded Population.
