## Scoring
Players now tally Victory Points:
- already earned on the Victory Track;
- from endgame Private Objectives;
- from their Stronghold: the number of tokens minus the number of Vice tokens, split equally among faction players (rounding down). **A player may choose to forfeit their share of the Stronghold to give the other player on their faction a Victory Point boost.**

The player with the most Victory Points wins.
