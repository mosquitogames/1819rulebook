## Endgame conditions

## Scoring
Players now tally Victory Points:
- already earned on the Victory Track;
- from endgame Private Objectives;
- from their Storehouse: the number of tokens minus the number of Vice tokens, split equally among faction players (rounding down). **A player may choose to forfeit their share of the Storehouse to give the other player on their faction a Victory Point boost.**

The player with the most Victory Points wins.

## Simulation
Don't put away legacy tiles.
