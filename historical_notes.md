## *1819*: The Historical Setting


**Stamford Raffles** and **William Farquhar**, both agents of the British East India Company, arrived in Singapore in 1819 seeking to seal a deal with the Malay Rajas, **Tengku Hussein** and **Temenggong Abdul Rahman**.

Both sides had interest in such an alliance. Singapore was part of the Johore empire---which stretched from Riau, Lingga to Johore and Pahang--- where shipping routes connecting the Far East and Europe via the Indian Ocean could be found. It was a region where the British hoped to establish a port to counter **Dutch** influence, and also one where the Malay Rajas wished to re-establish their place in the political hierarchy.

The decline of the Malay Rajas' influence had been set in motion since the early 18th century. **Bugis** warrior-chiefs had been brought in to help in dynastic intrigues, and ended up being the actual powers behind the throne.

The Malay rulers though remained important through the force of *daulat*---a mystical aura of royal authority that was believed to inhabit their bodies and preserved the realm.

When the Dutch defeated the Bugis in 1724, they in turn became the de facto power in the region, though once again indigenous chiefs---both the Bugis and the Malay Rajas---retained enough influence over the peoples in the Johore empire to remain a factor.

A dynastic succession issue presented the British with an opportunity to claim legitimacy for their own presence in Singapore in 1819. The last Malay Sultan had passed away in 1811, and two of his sons had claims on the throne. The Dutch and the Bugis backed the younger brother, leaving the elder brother, Tengku Hussein (and his ally, the Temenggong) in the cold.

The British therefore offered to give their support for Tengku Hussein, to establish him as the **Sultan** of Singapore---he in turn would give their presence there legitimacy in the eyes of both locals and European courts. And so the **Singapore Treaty of 1819** was signed.

The Dutch were not pleased, of course, and in the early days, there were serious doubts about whether the British would remain for long. But Singapore's growth as a successful port quickly made its value clear to the British. The **Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824** then saw the two European powers agreeing to settle their disputes in the region---including Dutch recognition of British possession of Singapore.

With the Dutch issue settled, the British now had much less need for the Malay Rajas' cooperation, and 1824 also saw a new Treaty of Friendship and Alliance signed in Singapore. While the 1819 agreement had recognised the Malay Rajas as equal partners, the 1824 one effectively stripped them of authority and power.

Sultan Hussein and his family eventually faded into obscurity, while the sons of the Temenggong charted a new path working with the British, and they came to be recognised as rulers of Johor, a lineage that remains to this day.

For the British themselves, Raffles and Farquhar would have their own disputes over how to run Singapore. Farquhar was much more respectful of local ways, and indeed adopted local customs like wearing a sarong. He also saw the importance of tax revenue from tax farms for opium, gambling and alcohol to pay for the upkeep of the settlement, especially since the **free port** nature of Singapore meant no revenues could be obtained from trade itself. He is today recognised as having played a crucial role in the early establishment of the settlement in Singapore.

Raffles was more disdainful of local practices, and sought to ban what he thought of as **vices**---including opium and gambling, but also the practice of slavery. He was critical of Farquhar’s approach in general, and eventually forced the latter out of Singapore.

Raffles’ vision for the settlements’ town planning did prove to be prescient, and while he ended dying at a relatively young age of 45, with his dreams of a peerage or a seat in parliament unfulfilled, his concrete achievements, a hagiographical biography by his widow, and the narrative needs of the British Empire saw his reputation grow over time, and he came to be seen as the founder of modern Singapore, with schools and hotels named after him,and statues erected in his honour.
