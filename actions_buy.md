## Buy Emporium Card

Buy one available card from the Emporium, then:

1. Resolve any instant effects;
2. Add the card to your tableau, making at most one connection; then
3. Shift all face-up cards to the right, and draw the top card of the Emporium deck to fill the leftmost space.

## Anatomy of an Emporium card
{: .no_toc }

![Emporium cards](/img/emporium_card_anatomy.jpg)

- **A. Price.** Some cards have distinct prices for British Agents (blue) and Malay Chiefs (green).
> *Example.* Natural History Drawings and Police Force cost $3 for all players. Syed Omar Aljunied costs British Agents $4, but Malay Chiefs only $2.
- **B. Instant effects.** These are resolved from top to bottom upon purchase of the card.
> *Example.* Upon purchase of Police Force, add 2 Influence to the board, then add one Player token to the Public Works track.

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Influence](/img/icons/influence.png) | Place *n* **Influence** tokens on Districts. See [Placing Influence](/important-concepts#placing-influence). |
| ![Move](/img/icons/move.png) | **Move** *n* cards in **your own** / <span style="color:red"><strong>any player's</strong></span> tableau. See [Moving cards](/important-concepts#moving-cards). |
| ![Wealth](/img/icons/wealth.png) | Gain *x* amount of **Wealth**. |
| ![Public Work](/img/icons/public_works.png) | **Public Works** card: Add Player token to Public Works track. See [Upkeep phase](/sequence-of-play#4-upkeep-phase). |
| ![Tax](/img/icons/tax.png) | **Tax** card: Add Player tokens to Tax track based on Tax Value. See [Upkeep phase](/sequence-of-play#4-upkeep-phase). |
| ![Personality](/img/icons/personality.png) | **Personality** card: Nothing to resolve. |
| ![Commerce](/img/icons/commerce.png) | **Commerce** card: Nothing to resolve. |
| ![Vice and Slavery](/img/icons/vice_slavery.png) | **Vice** / <span style="color:red"><strong>Slavery</strong></span> card: Nothing to resolve. |

- **C. Population slots.** Cards with Population symbols can accommodate Population cards. Some Actions depend on the number of Population cards attached.

> *Example.* Syed Omar Aljunied can accommodate one Population card, while Police Force can accommodate two.

- **D. Connectors.** Connectors allow cards to be organized into Communities, powerful groups of cards that can be Activated all at once.

![Community](/img/community.jpg)

Connections can be made between connectors with **opposite shapes** and **identical colors**. When you buy an Emporium card, make up to 1 valid connection.

> *Example.* You have 4 cards in your Tableau:
- Cathedral and Hajjah Fatimah are connected.
- Alexander Guthrie and Sports Day *could have been* connected, using Guthrie's left connector.

> You buy Gutta Percha Plantation.
- It can connect with *either* Hajjah Fatimah or Alexander Guthrie.
- However, you must choose only **one** connection to make.

To make, break, or change connections after purchase, use [the Move action](/important-concepts#moving-cards).

- **E. Boosts, Actions and End Game bonuses.**
    - Boosts are passives or special modifiers that take effect as soon as the card is bought --- even before instant effects are resolved.
    - Actions are triggered whenever a card is Activated, and are described using the same iconography as Immediate Effects. See [Activate](/activate).
    - End Game bonuses provide additional ways to earn VPs at endgame.
