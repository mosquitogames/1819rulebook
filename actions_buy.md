- **C. Population slots.** Cards with Population symbols can accommodate Population cards. Some Actions depend on the number of Population cards attached.

> *Example.* Syed Omar Aljunied can accommodate one Population card, while Police Force can accommodate two.

- **D. Connectors.** Connectors allow cards to be organized into Communities, powerful groups of cards that can be Activated all at once.

![Community](/img/community.jpg)

Connections can be made between Connectors with **opposite shapes** and **identical colors**. When you buy a Market card, make up to 1 valid connection.

> *Example.* You have 4 cards in your Tableau:
- Cathedral and Hajjah Fatimah are connected.
- Alexander Guthrie and Sports Day *could have been* connected, using Guthrie's left Connector.

> You buy Gutta Percha Plantation.
- It can connect with *either* Hajjah Fatimah or Alexander Guthrie.
- However, you must choose only **one** connection to make.

To make, break, or change connections after purchase, use [the Move action](/1819rulebook/important-concepts#moving-cards).

- **E. Actions, Boosts and End Game bonuses.**
    - **Actions** are triggered whenever a card is Activated, and are described using the same iconography as Immediate Effects. See [Activate](/1819rulebook/activate).
    - **Boosts** are passives or special modifiers that take effect as soon as the card is bought.
    - **End Game bonuses** provide additional ways to earn VPs once the game ends.
