## Declare War

<!-- *Declare War to corner your opponents and drain their resources.* -->

Spend 7 tokens of any colour from your Storehouse to declare War on **one** player in the opponent faction. After the Treaty of London, the cost of War drops to 4 tokens.

**War counts as 2 Actions.** It occurs in 4 stages:

1. Faction-mates decide whether to join the War or sit it out.
2. Each player involved in War commits up to one Battle card by placing it face down on the table.
3. The attacker and defender each roll 2 dice, then reveal the Battle cards.
4. The player with the higher total Strength **(die roll + faction Battle card/s)** wins!

## The Aftermath

Discard all revealed Battle cards. Remove a ship from the Port.

The winner may **steal the loser's Wealth** and/or **gain Victory Points** up to a maximum of **Total Strength difference \\(\times\\) Spoils of War Multiplier**.

![Battle example.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zksdvwcj716aqyi/battle_example.png?dl=1)

> *Example.*
The Resident *(British Agent)* attacks the Sultan *(Malay Chief)*. The Temenggong comes to the Sultan's aid.
- The Resident rolls a 3 and reveals HMS Andromache, for Total Strength of 10.
- The Sultan rolls a 1 and reveals Perahu and Giant Kusu, for Total Strength of 9.
- The Resident wins with Total Strength difference of \\(10 - 9 = 1\\).
- The Spoils of War Multiplier is 3.

> So the Resident may steal up to $3 from the Sultan, gain up to 3 VPs, or some combination of both. He chooses to steal $1 and gain 2 VPs.

The winner may choose to share the spoils with their faction-mate. The loser's faction-mate may choose to absorb some of the loser's losses. Neither is required.

<!-- 
The attacker and defender may each withdraw as many tokens from their respective faction Storehouses as they wish. Each token counts as 1 Strength.

<!-- > **3-player game: the solo player may commit 2 battle cards.** -->
